// A program integrating skills learned in COP 2006.

/*Foreword: I'm thinking of making a Blackjack card game. Or perhaps a collection of card games using ASCII graphics
This main class for the time being is serving as a way for me to at least make sure I have the minimum requirements
complete for the integration project milestones. Hopefully by the time I actually sit down for a couple of hours to work
on this, a lot of the code here will actually be replaced by code that will actually run the game. I'm just going to start
with a PLayingCard class and go from there, pls don't be mad.

//typing the word "sysout", then pressing [Ctrl + Space] yields "System.out.println();"
//scan.nextLine(); consumes the rest of the line. Any time you go from entering a number to entering a string, add a "scan.nextLine();" before "String a = scan.nextLine();"

//Variable: A place in memory to store a value
//Scope: Describes the location in which a Variable is defined. A variable defined in a method is a "local" variable and is only accessible within that method. A variable defined in a class, but not a method, is a "global" variable and is accessible from all methods within the class.

//Byte: Consists of 8 bits, can represent 2^8 numbers, from -128 to 127 (integers)
//Short: 16 bits, 2^16 (integers)
//Int: 32 bits 2^32 (integers)
//Long: 64 bits, 2^64 (integers) Ends with a 'L'
//Float: 32 bit, single precision (0.1) (decimal) Ends with a 'f'
//Double: 64 bit, double precision (0.01) (decimal) Ends with a 'd'
//Boolean: Undefined size, holds either true or false, so it acts like a special bit
//Char: Single 16-bit Unicode character from '\u0000' (0) to '\uffff' (65,535) Written with singular quotes, NOT double quotes
